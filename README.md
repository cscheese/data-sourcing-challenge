#Module 6 Challenge
Carolyn Scheese - 8/26/2024

# Background of homework. 
This challenge involved extracting data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then I merged and cleaned the data. 
The output was a cvs file. 

# Challenges, Resources and Help: 
Setting up the API. I had difficulty with this step. AskBCS helped me resolve this error and After Class Office hours also helped with this. 
I struggled with the first section - NYT, attending after class office hours, reviewing past class videos, examing class exercises and using ChatGPT and Xpert to generate code. 
All of these things helped, but the most helpful was the recent office hours with Bill and Sean and the final help came from my son who does data management for a finacial firm. He helped identify an error in the 
way I had set up the API key and URL codes (there was a redundancy that was causing errors that were not showing up until several steps later). Fixing this error helped correct the majority of the rest of the code. 
The data merging and cleaning was relatively easy comparitively. Again, ChatGPT, X-pert, looking at other code in class assignments and after class office hours helped me complete this homework. 
I can't begin to tell you where each piece of code came from. I had many, many revisons. I may have even had a little bit of help, early on from a tutor. 
I found that the code I got from ChatGPT and X-pert this time around was not very helpful. Infact, there were many, many errors in this code. 
Because of the way I was managing the duplication of cells in Jupyter Lab, it was confusing because I was copying and pasting too many pieces of code. 
I finially went back to the original code and cleaned up my code and the Jupyter lab. This helped me understand what was going on and it helped me better understand the code. 
I am starting to understand the code better. Studying for this class is very different from any other type of class I have taken. I'm improving little by little. And I have a better idea about how to manage testing code within jupyter lab. 
Thanks. Carolyn
